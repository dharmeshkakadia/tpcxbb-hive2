-- TASK:
-- For a given product get a top 30 list sorted by number of views in descending order of the last 5 products that are mostly viewed before the product
-- was purchased online. For the viewed products, consider only products in certain item categories and viewed within 10
-- days before the purchase date.


-- IMPLEMENTATION NOTICE: 
-- The task exceeds "click session" boundaries: all clicks of a user within the 10 days before purchase time frame have to be considered.
-- Theoretically you could view this task as a "market basket analysis" with a very large basket (all clicks of a user for every purchase), which would be inefficient.
-- This is a classic MR filtering job which cannot be easily expressed and executed efficiently in hive/sql.
-- This does not mean you can't express the job purely in HQL. By cleverly employing windowing functions with "preceding" rows and "lag" it can be achieved.
-- However this implementation uses a custom reducer streaming job script, which enforces the "last 10 days" and "last 5 views" constraints in a sequential fashion.
-- The employed python script does not require excessive caching or joining besides buffering the "last 5" in a circular LRU cache.
-- The reduce python script requires the input to be pre-partitioned by user_sk and pre-sorted on virtual timestamp (wcs_click_date_sk*24*60*60 + wcs_click_time_sk) by hive.
