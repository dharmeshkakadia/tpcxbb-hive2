UNDER DEVELOPMENT
-works-



Issues/to-do:

1. Mahout result is gibberish: there is a bug in mahout k-means clustering that returns NULL, which gives incorrect EuclideanDistanceMeasure
	-fix: need to install patch
	-note: also applies to Query 26
2. The splitting takes place on 1 node as things stand right now; would like to spread the task across the cluster. Takes impossibly long right now!
3. mahout output needs to be formatted to specification
