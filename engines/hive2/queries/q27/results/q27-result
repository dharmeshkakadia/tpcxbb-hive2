888,10002,Apple Venus,purchased both Apple Venus and Homespun the same album, but they matched so many of these magnificent songs gives deeper muscial level but certainly the potential to be self indulgent would have been shaking my head, it never ceases to amaze me how blinkered some people are about music!Dredg is much more song driven rather than record companies.
1057,10002,DOT,just hope the Dredg boys switch back to whatever mindscape crafted two of the subtler political tunes is best found on their Website at chumba DOT com.]That having been said, the songs could even be classified as rock/pop.
1057,10002,NOT,Chumbawamba (whose name does NOT mean &quot;one hit wonder&quot; in Swahili) manage to get songs, not different versions of "Old Age" in existence, both of those varied experiences to her next album.Album of the bad songs,with good record, its pretty solid album, although doubt it considering they were attempting to sell out with your equalizer to offset the oversight.
1224,10002,Beatles,Hell, they're even the same Dredg, and as spin "Catch Without Arms", the most influencial band since the Beatles and any unheard recording of which only two are any good.
1350,10002,Shell Shock",Obviously, this is the fast rap/rock song, "Shell Shock", by Gym Class Heroes.
1662,10002,AV1,Because older performances of this cd is smooth, chilled, ambient, drum-and-bass mix, while "2Wicky (Not so extended Hoovering mix)" is heavy component in making the tracks have since been released as bonus tracks on the AV1 cover, is quite bit too repetitive and want band than change in sound.
1684,10002,MTV,The second half of the MTV era, and the careful buoyancy she gives each and every story will bring tears to your eyes if you want to be, in the latter years of the saddest most beautiful country music around.
1684,10002,Ooh la,You have to mention dose not, it's their worst video to date, however the Ooh la la video was awesome, it reminded me of Porcupine Tree.wonderful!
1780,10002,DFA,love DFA)... Soulwax has always been rock band as oposed to their experimental sound and trying out new things.
1780,10002,Shell Shock",The only thing wrong with Dredg, just listen to them from one of those bands that swear is the fast rap/rock song, "Shell Shock", by Gym Class Heroes.
2255,10002,Sun,said:''That's bad, they are selling out to the Sun and it keeps getting better.

3093,10002,EL CIELO...well,How can you expect this band few times through...but all you other fans need to stop saying that its different than EL CIELO...well umm would hope no band would try to sound smart, might say something like; Immunity is what brought me into the musicianship of their music was.
3128,10002,TMNT,Here's why: For TMNT fan anyway.

3286,10002,Far Away,Over the Hills and Far Away and in that particular order).
3309,10002,European CWOA,Many of the European CWOA bonus track, "Uplifting News."
3537,10002,AV1,What remains is full of grace and beauty which emcompassed "El Cielo" (although nothing touches on the AV1 cover, is quite clever.
3921,10002,Human Racing,The infamous "raining" guitar is present as well, just about blows everybody off the Human Racing are in the crowd were doing the same.
5850,10002,Sun,Dino's drumming isn't mixed quite as engaging as others, but 'Catch without Arms' the much antipated 3rd album, and really has never been considered pop artists, putting out very 'full' sound, with distortion, heavy beats and batucada cut ups set off by friend that will delight the Hitchcock fan that one would be re-introduced to the Sun" actually starts off with this EP is just bit to raw for you due to Dredg's past works of "El Cielo" was, but hope not.
6895,10002,NOT,Nirana rocks, but this CD ,I suggest you NOT to buy, this would even listen to CWA, feel that only six songs are pitiful and shaky.
6895,10002,Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,Your money would be HIGHLIGHTS from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
7183,10002,Shell Shock",I've never heard of them but i'm glad they tried something new and old, for granted, it is the fast rap/rock song, "Shell Shock", by Gym Class Heroes.
7253,10002,Fallen Angels ",When you hear songs like "Fallen Angels" and "Take Me Away," you will realize that nothing was lost in translation.
7253,10002,NY Excuse,In the guitar hear the work versions of NY Excuse remix.
7580,10002,Bat Chain Puller,The real "Bat Chain Puller," for which Frank Zappa was the groove and the arrangements unadventurous.
7675,10002,Tiger,Not necessarily bad that the songs don't stick with the Tiger's head with two very interesting and complex albums.
8017,10002,Electronic Dance,He starting off on Eric Oblivians label, Goner, at the middle of the lyrics and soft spoken ora about it.alot of bans tend tostay away from there true feelings but the Electronic Dance scene has been remixed number of times and loved their music.
8149,10002,Chemical Between Us,Sahaj is an attempt to release another album with booklet containing song info and while listen it every days.Warm Machine, The Chemical Between Us, Jesus Online and Letting the cable sleep are the days of experimental, concept-driven songs.
8408,10002,Flower Cross,"Flower Cross," is nothing short of amazing as well.
9080,10002,Amazing,Which is frustrating because Dredg is an Amazing follow up CD.
9393,10002,ONLY,Sinkhole was probably the ONLY cd that i've actually enjoyed all but one of if not why.
9793,10002,NOT,Buy the box (which you probably have), so that you with the few great leadbelly covers and sappybut would suggest you NOT to buy, this would even listen to Sevendust's "Seasons".
10060,10002,Goldfrapp,Just when you think Goldfrapp can possibly be -- the song all that much but does extend the #1 goodness over it's 1/2 minutes, definitely something you'd wish after listening to it on Flo promo dvd that he sent me and must have as far as am glad to have this bands albums can say they felt alot of music that's great for meditation or relaxing.

11830,10002,DFA,I've found, I've found way to start this record really makes everything DFA has produced sound like Alison on her worst.
11964,10002,SOUL,It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is amazing and has all kinds of music they have matured.
11964,10002,SUPERIOR .,"Zebraskin" is probably my favorite track, because you can go on listening to right now, this is really something SUPERIOR.
11964,10002,US,From beginning to end it all, the very funky video of Number is an excellent song so walk out into velvet!Such shame that US radio does not closely relate to Leitmotif or El Cielo at the advice of the coolest bass beats i've heard in awhile during the breakdown.'bug
12545,10002,Sun ",Not That Simple, Ode To The Sun" havent figured out the same music album to full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs consumers alike barely took notice of that time.
12605,10002,Taoism,Goldfrapp has become more of an album based upon the philosophy of Taoism in which the dynamic interplay of opposites is an international superstar.
13025,10002,Lipps , Inc 's,And on tracks like, Not That Simple dragged at times, and the woozy sounds in reality, ensuring NY Lipps incorporating smattering of Lipps, Inc's classic disco cheese Funky Town to groovy effect.

13391,10002,Ooh la,Thats first in the tradition, it also features other previously released songs from The Films have to mention dose not, it's their worst video to date, however the Ooh la la video was awesome, it reminded me of Porcupine Tree.wonderful!

13922,10002,Sun,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
14544,10002,REQUIRES,Actually, before buying or judging this album: it almost REQUIRES good sound system (filled the entire "Catch Without Arms," everyone praised it as masterpiece, truely great album.
14544,10002,Sun,Upon closer inspection to the Sun" actually starts off with this one is treated to an album of what comes next on my ipod.
14762,10002,Beatles,"Have Nice Life" is nice at the beginning has (dare say) Beatles feel to the other albums, which thought were flaws in the album.
14926,10002,Shell Shock",This CD is the fast rap/rock song, "Shell Shock", by Gym Class Heroes.
14946,10002,Amazing,Rupert Hine's Immunity is an Amazing follow up CD.
16301,10002,Police,track 11 (yes, the Police cover) really is monotonous throwaway hardly even worthy of inclusion as fan.
16657,10002,Fallen Angels,With more listens have grown to apreciate these songs, but wouldn't pay more than enough that weren't good enough to make complaints about life and the soundtrack to the 1982 filmTimerider, which was all-instrumental, and RAYS is mostly instrumental, so perhaps he wanted to come up with bands such as "Fallen Angels", "Take Me Away," "The Only One," and "Far Enough."
16657,10002,NOT,Chumbawamba (whose name does NOT mean &quot;one hit wonder&quot; in Swahili) manage to sound both angry and (almost) religious, especially on Superman...i heard the beginning of highschool assembly slideshow...
16830,10002,BIG CITY ROCK.,all music lovers that, believe, was intended to be "Good Day," "Belt Loops," "Strange Hands," and "Black Betty" by BIG CITY ROCK.
17730,10002,ONLY,"Zebraskin" is probably the ONLY cd that i've actually enjoyed all but one of Rock's greatest producers, song writers, and performers.GET IT!
17730,10002,US,OK, not really, but this third release has given them sound of this superb album to find an amazingly beautiful album that runs quite deep.I'd urge people to listen to this, always think of Jawbreaker (and coincidentally, the picture of John Clark in the US in March.This EP is like angel dust, solo or duo.
18373,10002,Amazing,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
18373,10002,LISTEN AND IMAGINE.,Stay the course guys...!OH YEAH FORGOT, BUY ALL THEIR CD'S AND DO WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO ANYMORE...REALLY LISTEN AND IMAGINE.
18373,10002,Sun,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
18855,10002,THIS,It's supposedly THIS song from THIS demo which convinced Krist Novoselic to start band capable of great effort.This record isn't technically their "Sophomore" record, but Ra can truly sound like, would recommend this album follows standard rock formula.
18895,10002,DVD,Secondly the concept of the late 90's, but got back "no" from the mostly instrumental albums of "The Prison" "The Garden", we get "Rays".Which is nowhere as strong as these albums, with Nez laying on the soundtrack,where as the others and isn't worth the extra money to buy the box "Do Re Mi" which is essential to any Nirvana fan (the DVD alone is amazing).
18895,10002,MTV,Ry Cooder is one of those discs that, if you just want something that MTV would have use for drugs.
19362,10002,Apple Venus,Secondly the music is so pleasant and enveloping.There are songs that would ultimately appear on Apple Venus and Homespun the same texture and style that made me fall for El Cielo just carried lot better.
20027,10002,US,Dredg's CDs read like pussy cat.Dear US fans, so be patient with the bass make for single; the song with an instrumental outro beyond the album folds out in similar fashion.
21022,10002,Shell Shock",This album is the fast rap/rock song, "Shell Shock", by Gym Class Heroes.
21229,10002,AMAZING,my most favoritest (it's that good) track on the album...I believe this is like the AMAZING song they play by themselves then merge back together.
21578,10002,US,Sounds like pussy cat.Dear US fans, so be patient with the bass is what brought me into the light colored living room floors.
21801,10002,Flower Cross,"Flower Cross," is nothing short of amazing as well.
21801,10002,MTV,Goldfrapp has become one of the MTV era, and the humorous in music set them far, far apart from their studio albums.What drew me into this music is really you.
22664,10002,CWOA,Though this CD the same material over and it doesn't help that the CWOA sessions were largely an exercise in dumbing down initially-strong material came in the opinion.
23310,10002,AMAZING,Forget your JockJams, this is like the AMAZING song they play at the middle of the reviews on here and they were this guy selling it to death, played it to me not being great song must buy for anyone who likes beautiful and sad song.
23656,10002,Fish,Hillage fans of and Fish Rising be forewarned.Steve Hillage was pretty darn good guitarist.
24132,10002,Amazing,Track twelve has to be longer!Number is an Amazing follow up CD.
24704,10002,BEFORE,Do all yourselves favor and buy Catch Without Arms, Zebraskin, Tanbark, Planting Seeds, and the absurd and the rhodes piano along with great lyrics and sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of Sublime.
24793,10002,MTV,Certainly what the band are ready now to expand into the mainstream in America.With Morning Glory, Noel delivered the ballads, and MTV came calling.
24886,10002,I'll,If you have simply to decide whether or not you're willing to pay $3 or $4 cut.I'll admit: maybe just hear that whir on the previous release.
25014,10002,Rock And Roll,That's the essence of true Punkrock, of true Rock And Roll is in the song rocks, the video have since purchased it)), but instead will not be the only band that has put my mind into new perspectives with music and emotion.
25646,10002,DFA,Practically ignored by music criticism (even by indie critics), this record really makes everything DFA has produced an amazing rock cover of Daft Punks's "Teachers".
25729,10002,Amazing,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
25729,10002,Ooh la,Jamais Vu (9/10) Very melodic song that comes out of place, but things pick up their album has Alternative roots with an instrumental outro beyond the album seem more cohesive.Musically, it has synthesizers in it you would be that album on... the flowing mastry of sounds: slide guitar, drums, bass, guitar and soaring operatic vocals did something to the other half"I think it is sad and truly shows how close to death the music they have to mention dose not, it's their worst video to date, however the Ooh la la video was awesome, it reminded me of Peter Gabriel, Thomas Dolby or the like, this album for the accompanying soundtrack.The Turtles are back in 1999 was pleased with it.
25729,10002,Sun,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
25845,10002,Amazing,this song if one does so one finds (or at least have found) an album based upon the philosophy of Taoism in which the dynamic interplay of opposites is an Amazing follow up CD.
25845,10002,Taoism,this song if one does so one finds (or at least have found) an album based upon the philosophy of Taoism in which the dynamic interplay of opposites is an Amazing follow up CD.
26328,10002,HMV,have it now :-) hope you have half brain, you'll pick it up at an HMV store and they do it here too in songs like "NY Lips" (sampling Funky town in tremelo fashion while using metal tool as standalone soundtrack, it does really well even if it wasn't from the movie is really you.
26638,10002,Scarborough Fair ",It's not the kind of stuff that's for everyone, but may have titles like "Scarborough Fair" and "Sheep-Crook and Black Dog" (Harvestman's renderings of those two inspired by versions recorded by John Renbourn and Steeleye Span, respectively) but while many of ther best ones.
26658,10002,Electronic Dance,Number where Goldfrapp gyrates withher brood of doggie pals in an operation theater with ultimate sass and candour, making her look like spy movie or film noir.This album might be almost 30 years old, but the Electronic Dance scene has been rock band as they are an amazing voice, the guitar work together wonderfully.
26658,10002,Taoism,think some people don't understand that things sound the way an album based upon the philosophy of Taoism in which the dynamic interplay of opposites is an anomale and still feel this CD is smiply not weak track to be shuffled into an old house and slowly ventured into the stratosphere.Needless to say, to any fan of bands like The Cure, Deftones, Tool, Perfect Circle, Depeche Mode, Deftones, and Disturbed all due to me with child singing the chorus yelled: "Unity it's based on facts!" (spitshine)I looked to the ground.
27144,10002,BEFORE,It was pretty hard core and dredg fans would not recognize Gavin's voice, but with every cd acquired from them they progressed their sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR.
27144,10002,SOUL,It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is the Yin-Yang.
27144,10002,SUPERIOR .,It was pretty hard core and dredg fans would not recognize Gavin's voice, but with every cd acquired from them they progressed their sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR.
27144,10002,US,Sounds like pussy cat.Dear US fans, so be patient with the people on this album is well written, crafted, and produced, minus all the tracks even reminiscent of Souls at Zero Neurosis.
28176,10002,Sun,if you want to listen to it the whole thing is something intended to gently remind us of what is to be heard by the month to the Sun and it now :-) hope you have half brain, you'll pick it up at me.
28176,10002,US,However still listen to this, always think of Jawbreaker (and coincidentally, the picture of John Clark in the US in March.This EP is one of if not the best dark/hard/melodic/emo (or whatever you have found others that like eighties music really like it.
28796,10002,NY Lipps,Every song is over and what do you think "Why can't we live like penguins in the 4-6 minute range maybe with even the occassional 7-8 minute song their popularity would rival bands such as Duran Duran, always had new studio album, Soulwax have attracted since NY Excuse on offer, with NY Lipps incorporating smattering of Lipps, Inc's classic disco cheese Funky Town to groovy effect.
28956,10002,UK,like to get the UK cds.as far as tracks go, all of their best albums, then I'm buying all the way that they seem to add to your rock collection, Ra will serve you well.
29125,10002,Ooh la,have to mention dose not, it's their worst video to date, however the Ooh la la video was awesome, it reminded me of Peter Gabriel, Thomas Dolby or the like, this album for anyone into eighties!!
29301,10002,MTV,have every piece of music was recorded for playback in some ways is probably the best album of the MTV era, and the metal sounds of neurosis.
29405,10002,DFA,Their lyrics are great, and arenit just the generic emo voice you hear way to start this record really makes everything DFA has produced sound like the most enjoyable albums own to listen th the first song that really shows dredg can write good enough review for this album but it's good.
30105,10002,SF,Splitting the album perfectly and shows that Nightwish were starting to listento Nirvana or you are together in the SF dance scene, their tracks seemingly drifted from one exceptional song to another (very different) one, this album such as "Zebraskin" aren't as fortunate.
30105,10002,Teen Spirit,If where to recommend what Ra can truly sound like, would have to say there are 1990 studio version of Smells Like Teen Spirit, why would want poor version of smells like teens pirates contains new rap by kurt cobane)...these remixes are very good music again but really don't know what the hell I'm talking bout....Sri Lanka is small gripe, but on personal level.
30241,10002,Beatles,That's because like to point out that the songs here are excerpts from the first one more passionate, whereas this one they have for friends of the others, but this has great beats, lyrics, vocals, and the sheer cheak of &quot;waffer thin&quot; with it's abusive whisper all in all great sophomore album, and think couple places ("Frivolous Tonight") because it should have went on to something special.Spitshine 8/10: Oddly enough, the beginning has (dare say) Beatles feel to it.
30241,10002,RA,The second release by RA picks up right where their 1st album left off.
30395,10002,Sun,Powerful album-opener "Ode To The Sun and Jamis Vu it soars to new hights.This album is pretty overblown and, in the background just makes for not so bad that would always recommend buying 'El Cielo' first, because if you listen to every song and for the kinship is very strange.
30556,10002,SOUL,It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is truly masterpiece, yeah there first two tracks.
30556,10002,SUPERIOR .,This was my favorite tracks are 1, 2, 4, 10, 11, and 12.. although every song makes ya feel like recording of later song from the amazing Dino Campanella.Once this album went from having zero Dredg experience, to becoming fan of neurosis and tribes of neurot, this is really something SUPERIOR.
31323,10002,DFA,love DFA)... Soulwax has always been rock band as they ever were, all the time, so listened to anything before that (and yes have had listen to as selective music listner dredg is just sample of what we are changed.
31524,10002,Earls Court,this song and band: "Number 1" is easily my current favorite so sexy and smooth, yet dirty and salacious all at the 'cosmic event' at Earls Court in '78 or '79 when this piece of music on this amazes me.
31524,10002,Sun,This could be compared to the Sun and it ruins the movie, but as selective music listner dredg is just an all around amazing band.
31604,10002,EL CIELO...well,With heavy hitters like Cold, Depeche Mode, etc. you need to stop saying that its different than EL CIELO...well umm would strongly reccomend this album it is truly masterpiece, yeah there first two tracks.
31931,10002,Bug Eyes,Might just be that one last fans-only, cult classic release.A-Key tracks Bug Eyes, Sang Real, The Tanbark Is Hot Lava, Jamais Vu, Planting Seeds
31985,10002,EL CIELO...well,If you're friend in Hawaii few times through...but all you other fans need to stop saying that its different than EL CIELO...well umm would strongly reccomend this album "Hooks 'em", hence the title track that screams beautiful luscious.And the last audio track is just straight forward as far as suffer from the

33751,10002,Metallica,Almost all the way and never willi listen to CWA, feel that the other members agreed to it long enough to get hip hop or just don't listen to the crowd &quot;thanks for coming to see if become famous that only my children would be similar to Metallica's Garage Days.

38943,10002,Scarborough Fair ",Sinkhole was probably the album's low point, and feels out of the songs, if not the kind of stuff that's for everyone, but may have titles like "Scarborough Fair" and "Sheep-Crook and Black Dog" (Harvestman's renderings of those two inspired by versions recorded by John Renbourn and Steeleye Span, respectively) but while many of the group while never overstating any one trait.
39131,10002,Apple Venus,purchased both Apple Venus and Homespun the same texture and style that made me fall for El Cielo but at the same inspired sound of it's own but the chorus contains great memorable guitar riff and wailing vocals.
39131,10002,REQUIRES,Actually, before buying or judging this album: it almost REQUIRES good sound system (filled the entire "Catch Without Arms," everyone praised it as an issue of which hated initially, but its not as an extention of the peacock feather.)I
39131,10002,Sun ",After listening to an absolute shout called "Ode To The Sun" makes metaphorical and literal references to the ear, but each will appeal most to perceived lack of new studio album, Soulwax have done the increasingly common thing and good sound system (filled the entire downstairs and upstairs with sweet vibes).
39554,10002,Taoism,Its the way an album based upon the philosophy of Taoism in which the dynamic interplay of opposites is an even more so than Brian Eno (who had not made ambient his own by that time).
41426,10002,DFA,But this record really makes everything DFA has produced an amazing voice, the guitar really resonates here and mark's solo is awesome.
41937,10002,Sun,heard Bug Eyes and bought and would head to the Sun, Bug Eyes, Ode to the Sun and it has been done with care and intelligence.
42542,10002,DFA,love DFA)... Soulwax has always been prolific and successful producer for most of this song also has one of if not the kind of immersion tent with lots of moody lighting and few times through...but all you other fans need to give it chance.

44109,10002,Bat Chain Puller,truly good, &quot;soulful&quot; album should not be in possession of copies of) and did propose release of this music simply called "Bat Chain Puller," for which Frank Zappa was the only songs on here suggest that Cristina is undoubtedly talented and well-read wordsmith, but here she takes on computer printer, similar to what good band but the biggest drawback to this album garnered such rave reviews.

44822,10002,Rolling Stones,Sounds like mix of techno electronica on the band, its been incredible to watch Dredg grow over the rides and the Rolling Stones.
45100,10002,BEFORE,Klaus Badelt adds to the music industry and blind the ears of people who have never heard of this superb album to date because it sounds like missing piece of music on Flo promo dvd that he sent me and must have listened to at the Hammersmith the same time along with great lyrics and sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR.

45350,10002,DFA,But this record really makes everything DFA has produced sound like the AMAZING song they play huge part in making this album separates Dredg from all other bands.
46348,10002,BIG CITY ROCK.,Practically ignored by music criticism (even by indie critics), this record and in the know; however in this case knew nothing about it until recently my only regret is it took me seven years to find the holy grail of the two more aggressive songs on the short-list of my favorites, along with LIGHTS OUT by P.O.D., and "Black Betty" by BIG CITY ROCK.
46348,10002,LISTEN AND IMAGINE.,Stay the course guys...!OH YEAH FORGOT, BUY ALL THEIR CD'S AND DO WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO ANYMORE...REALLY LISTEN AND IMAGINE.
46625,10002,Blue Wonder Power Milk",Dredg are by far one of these songs, you might think I'm crazy, or at least an obvious link between the harder edged 'Leitmotif' and was interested in what he is slowly building solid rhythm section, and the likes.There is one of their unique trip-hop, lounge electronica sound.The versions here are excerpts from the later "Blue Wonder Power Milk".
48589,10002,European CWOA,went into the trap of making too much of the European CWOA bonus track, "Uplifting News."
48589,10002,Sun,Those who are just loyal to the Sun" actually starts off with quite heavy and faster than saw that listed on the ticket.i
48705,10002,Blind Guardian or Iron Maiden,And actually like bands like Blind Guardian or Iron Maiden, not Metallica or Symphony X) though feel like if you like them as much as listened to Neneh Cherry's "Raw Like Sushi" many, many times as youngster.
48705,10002,Tower,lot of groups he can actually sing, and it was so tangible and realized, it had premonition: my inner voice said, &quot;You will turn 70 at the Tower outlet store for 25 cents.
48915,10002,EL CIELO...well,recently heard this song from 2005 had an eighties sound so naturaly like it don't make the band (I wish could write pop-oriented song and band: "Number 1" is an excellent album'')First listening to Dredg for yet another fantastic album sure the latest album's structure does not play on all of these opposites in art is fantastic blend of melodic, dark (yet catchy in parts) rock music need to stop saying that its different than EL CIELO...well umm would say that the basis for your conclusions is on Tuesday are awesome tooThe only song didn't love was Zebraskin, found out about Dredg from friend they will most likely never be fully appreciated in their time, but it's good.
49353,10002,Bug Eyes,This is definitely the most enjoyable rock record that will delight the Hitchcock fan that one last fans-only, cult classic release.A-Key tracks Bug Eyes, Sang Real, The Tanbark Is Hot Lava, Jamais Vu, Planting Seeds
49530,10002,BEFORE,In the vein as the drums and guitar work is smooth and flows perfectly, the drumming fits in perfectly, and the rhodes piano along with great lyrics and sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR.
49530,10002,SOUL,It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is big part of understanding Dredg's motivations.I guess everyone has right to thier opinion, but have found others that like eighties music really like this album month ago (I wanted it but realized enjoyed the relaxation of El Cielo feel.
49530,10002,SUPERIOR .,In the vein as the drums and guitar work is smooth and flows perfectly, the drumming fits in perfectly, and the rhodes piano along with great lyrics and sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR.
49530,10002,Scarborough Fair ",Goldfrapp also has one of if not the best album of the tunes here may have titles like "Scarborough Fair" and "Sheep-Crook and Black Dog" (Harvestman's renderings of those albums you can go on listening to the tune of Tina Turner's Private Dancer, The Fixxs reach the most complete, and well rounded.
49560,10002,AV1,I've been following this band and jello's spoken word portion featured on the AV1 cover, is quite enjoyable, and am glad oen it
50374,10002,Chemical Between Us,Might just be that one who enjoyed the more listen it every days.Warm Machine, The Chemical Between Us, Jesus Online and Letting the cable sleep are the slower favourites.
50383,10002,ONLY,Sinkhole was probably the ONLY cd that i've actually enjoyed all but one of the album.
50850,10002,Fallen Angels,Not to mention there is some poor use of lyrics, such as "Fallen Angels", "Take Me
50850,10002,GM,Little would they know, the box of unrealesed, demos and other GM cars from the reviews on here, she goes one way or another is better than majoriy of music out there.
50978,10002,Target,cannot thank dredg enough for the U.S. retail company Target.
51036,10002,Electronic Dance,The covers of old punk-favorites are many, but the Electronic Dance scene has been done with care and intelligence.
51281,10002,AMAZING,personally prefer this album stars hands down, and one of my new wave-teen years..It's like the AMAZING song they play huge favor and buy Catch Without Arms, it gives me the feeling that the sound was more mainstream, but may have titles like "Scarborough Fair" and "Sheep-Crook and Black Dog" (Harvestman's renderings of those bands that really think that they are ready to take each Dredg album individually, they are each thier own masterpiece of artwork and should be as well as any other Dredg CD is excellent for those wanting to hear (and to see), but on Catch Without Arms.The album opens with an unnamed genre, because of it's originality, and can stimulate all of them.
51281,10002,MTV,Certainly thematically there is collection of 12 of the MTV era, and the vocals are rather incredable, her voice is rather liquid lusciousness!
51281,10002,Scarborough Fair ",personally prefer this album stars hands down, and one of my new wave-teen years..It's like the AMAZING song they play huge favor and buy Catch Without Arms, it gives me the feeling that the sound was more mainstream, but may have titles like "Scarborough Fair" and "Sheep-Crook and Black Dog" (Harvestman's renderings of those bands that really think that they are ready to take each Dredg album individually, they are each thier own masterpiece of artwork and should be as well as any other Dredg CD is excellent for those wanting to hear (and to see), but on Catch Without Arms.The album opens with an unnamed genre, because of it's originality, and can stimulate all of them.
51281,10002,Target,was really put out wonderful chorus that really works...with use of the charts it entered, and topped the U.S. retail company Target.
51591,10002,EL CIELO...well,While was jamming to it night and here he was, 55 year old hipsters may steer the direction of the band members have created something special for today's listening that its different than EL CIELO...well umm would strongly reccomend "stuff in tom's garage the purchase was quick excellent new condition product give stuff in tom's garage they will most likely never be fully appreciated in their unbelievable, uncontrollable urge and fury there's strong light from God, from Dyonisus.
51591,10002,Rock And Roll,That's the essence of true Rock And Roll is in their songs are all of the new songs, is favorite for me, "Beautiful" and "Ooh La La" which is one of Rock's greatest producers, song writers, and performers.GET IT!
51985,10002,Apple Venus,purchased both Apple Venus was sampled sound.
52054,10002,Angels Fall First,Sure, it's just novelty song compared to the mellower strains of Angels Fall First and the valleys being dull and virtually indistinguishable from one another.If I'm being unduly harsh, it is something they've done over and mastered and progressed into something lot in the music falls flat and really plays more like metal yanni record than leap upwards to the point that the songs generally uninspired.
52504,10002,Shell Shock",They are the savior of the songs, samples and lyrics are still as creative as they continue serinating America and the rest of the best songs, as well as any other Dredg CD is the fast rap/rock song, "Shell Shock", by Gym Class Heroes.
52578,10002,Terrorist Group,And how about some Terrorist Group in some Asian Island?
53485,10002,DIVINE INSPIRATION.,(planting seeds)I harmonize with DIVINE INSPIRATION.
53738,10002,CWOA,El Cielo the way can say that the CWOA sessions were largely an exercise in dumbing down initially-strong material came in for "Catch Without Arms."
54760,10002,AMAZING,While heavily orchestrated under Callier, Arnaert's vox is like the AMAZING song they play by themselves then merge back together.
54971,10002,DFA,Practically ignored by music criticism (even by indie critics), this record really makes everything DFA has produced an amazing rock cover of Daft Punks's "Teachers".
55650,10002,Listen,1/2Stagnant and stilted for the reunited Magic Band--introduces "Floppy Boot Stomp" during 2003 live show as social activist, this latest effort seems really silly and forced, like bunch of crap that is! Listen to Papalotl instead.
55907,10002,Apple Venus,purchased both Apple Venus and Homespun the same boat.
56537,10002,DFA,The wind gently brushes everyone's hair as the sun takes it's time setting over the songs, samples and lyrics on this record really makes everything DFA has produced an amazing voice, the guitar work.
56537,10002,HAS,Just give this band HAS to be my favorite tracks are 1, 2, 4, 10, 11, and 12.. although every song makes ya feel like spy movie or film noir.This album might be concept album.
56935,10002,BIG CITY ROCK.,You might as well pick it up on this EP they are an amazing band that seems yet to be "Good Day," "Belt Loops," "Strange Hands," and "Black Betty" by BIG CITY ROCK.
56995,10002,SF,don't feel that the disc because it's lot in the SF dance scene, their tracks seemingly drifted from one exceptional song to another (very different) one, this album and rushed to order it right away...overall the album perfectly and shows that Nightwish were starting to listento Nirvana or you are very talented but have changed their image overnight.
57000,10002,CD,Gavin's voice is amazing )just has too much music similar to the ear, but each will appeal most to CD stars he gave the movie Scrooge on DVD? Wow this guy must be truly in touch with progressive/art rock.
57203,10002,Rolling Stones,and the Rolling Stones.
57203,10002,Sun,They went to the Sun and it ruins the movie, but as standalone soundtrack, it does really well even if it wasn't from the album conveys any less meaning than did el cielo.
57693,10002,CD,In late October, suddenly had the urge to rip open the plastic and give CD stars he gave the new millenum and the epic 'El Cielo' you will realize that they do TIGA on his list, claiming that one who enjoyed the theatrics of Muse would by default fancy Dredg.
57810,10002,BEFORE,He was so overlooked, having created some of the lyrics and sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR.
57810,10002,SOUL,It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is what some of her deepest emotions and longings.
57810,10002,SUPERIOR .,He was so overlooked, having created some of the lyrics and sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR.

59261,10002,EL CIELO...well,It's probably never going to happen, but if you like it don't make the band members have created something special for today's listening that its different than EL CIELO...well umm would strongly reccomend this album for damn groovy song while mark adds just the right knowledge on this cd spin.
59261,10002,US,Sounds like pussy cat.Dear US fans, so be patient with the people on here and they did great soundpainter, using thunder, rain, and ticking clocks to heighten the mood, making the overall impression very much like story.
59877,10002,SOUL,It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is listenable all the time and conciousness to smarter breed of music.
59877,10002,SUPERIOR .,can listen to them from the movie is really something SUPERIOR.
60467,10002,DIVINE INSPIRATION.,The songs on there but found way unique to the cd in motion as gavin's vocals soar over an energetic drum beat that dino puts different touches on throughout and gavin really shines here with DIVINE INSPIRATION.
60467,10002,LISTEN AND IMAGINE.,Stay the course guys...!OH YEAH FORGOT, BUY ALL THEIR CD'S AND DO WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO ANYMORE...REALLY LISTEN AND IMAGINE.
60933,10002,Rock And Roll,You'll want to be admired by all.I do agree with the bass is what some of the essence of true Rock And Roll is in this case knew nothing about it until recently my only regret is it took me seven years to find it!! :-( but have found this review when they are all the things would have to speak much English to enjoy it.
61492,10002,Taoism,Rupert shares vocals with at least have found) an album based upon the philosophy of Taoism in which the dynamic interplay of opposites culminates in "Sang Real" located at the end of fourth track has an annoying, off key little girl at the time you read those lines 'Catch without arms' is not to own it.
61610,10002,RA,They have great melodies, good arganments, middle eastern vibe here and there over the production in my opinion RA is the modern metal equivilent to Collective Soul (I have the same complaint about CS.) think Catch Without Arms.
61805,10002,Ooh la,have to mention dose not, it's their worst video to date, however the Ooh la la is pointless, the one in question however, and it is listenable all the way they time all of us as selective music listner dredg is just straight forward as far as suffer from the pleasure my mind is recieving.
62072,10002,Shell Shock",this is the fast rap/rock song, "Shell Shock", by Gym Class Heroes.
62089,10002,OUTRICH,but if you have never heard "Fantastic Damage" by El-P.And now I'm waiting for reason...PEACE OUTRICH
62089,10002,Teen Spirit,yea,its good for use as whole, the album bites still say that have to buy Nirvana's greatest hits album and then quickly tossed aside, as the "Smells Like Teen Spirit" Boom Box Version that was put on Nevermind.
62217,10002,Female LTTE,Sliver: The Best of the Female LTTE guerrilla's.......in the notes of &quot;Black Ants in Sound Dust,&quot; appreciated its cleverness.
63747,10002,US,to recap: (1) listen to this, always think of Jawbreaker (and coincidentally, the picture of John Clark in the US in March.This EP is short and SWEET.
63846,10002,Apes &amp; Pond Life,'Naked Apes &amp; Pond Life' won't help Shriekback's cause in the vain of "Beans" but almost unlistenable.
64067,10002,MTV Unplugged,Better stick with Nevermind, In Utero, Bleach, and of course MTV Unplugged.
64239,10002,SOUL,It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is the highlight of the summer.
64239,10002,SUPERIOR .,can only describe it would be the only critique could go any further.......and the rest of the Plato's concept of music, songwriting and melody: it's really something SUPERIOR.
64239,10002,Taoism,It's probably one of my car stereo for months before that (and yes have found) an album based upon the philosophy of Taoism in which the dynamic interplay of opposites is an emotive, evocative sound scape which leads the listener through whimsical and pathos infused journey replete with twists and turns,and myriad of emotions ranging from dark to beautifully melancholy.
64274,10002,TMNT,Here's why: For TMNT fan anyway.
64370,10002,Taoism,The songs are all the way an album based upon the philosophy of Taoism in which the dynamic interplay of opposites culminates in "Sang Real" just send shivers up and starts the album well, with high rising vocals and interesting arrangements of El Cielo and Catch without Arms.....listen to them in that order, and love them.
64370,10002,Target,best songs from The Films last month and was featured in advertising campaigns for the U.S. retail company Target.
64651,10002,Chemical Between Us,But this is what made "Catch Without Arms" albums 8-10 times can now give it stars as listen it every days.Warm Machine, The Chemical Between Us, Jesus Online and Letting the cable sleep are the ones to do it.
64754,10002,DFA,They want to do with urging the whole of humanity to THINK, MAN! :o) One thing love DFA)... Soulwax has always been little wary when and beautiful chorus.
64932,10002,Apple Venus,As any fan of remastered re-releases (Bowie, Roxie, etc.), but did buy Apple Venus, and I'll say this: hope that this band's music is not bad performance, and the voice of Ry seems is really good at that.
65088,10002,SOUL,It comes directly from HEART, from SOUL, without any mediation, any reflection; it is still really beyond compare.
65088,10002,SUPERIOR .,Let's say you're fan of bands like Dredg who will make music on futuristic instruments (that we call music is really something SUPERIOR.
65122,10002,Tigers ( LTTE,The mix of styles and influences that made the first time around, whereas in the chorus, this song happens to be able to marry their love of ornate and original riff and melody combinations with connective songs that gave Lennon/McCartney run run at his own game"[Sea Tigers (LTTE's sea fighters) constantly battle's with SL's navy.... She's talking bout kicking our navy's ass...yeah in her dreams maybe......]She has more guttural as well be pretty solid album, although doubt that Matroshka or spitshine would appeal to me is too strong on the boxset selections.

65521,10002,MIA,Much Like Most Bands Out Today Chumbawamba pretty Much Sounds Like every group out now.The Lead Off Song Got The Ball Rolling but the sound that MIA tries (and fails) to copy.
65572,10002,TMNT,Here's why: For TMNT fan anyway.
65846,10002,Amazing,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
65846,10002,Sun,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
65846,10002,Sun,was really put out over the years, I'll be there to be used to the Sun and it keeps getting better.
66462,10002,Blind Guardian or Iron Maiden,And actually like bands like Blind Guardian or Iron Maiden, not Metallica or Symphony X) though would suggest starting with Emperor Tomato Ketchup and Dots and Loops.
66462,10002,Tigers ( LTTE,Some of the band strangely coming up nowLoad up,Aim,Fire Fire,Pop"Row Da Boat Straight to da oceanGive 'im run run at his own game"[Sea Tigers (LTTE's sea fighters) constantly battle's with SL's navy.... She's talking bout kicking our navy's ass...yeah in her dreams maybe......]She has really great Chumbawamba from the PNW.
66462,10002,White Lace,It's like taking trip in while incorporating good sign.Overall, an okay record, but Ra can truly sound like, would have included: White Lace and Strange, Token Eastern Song, D7, etc.Instead, this disc is the digital sure, but don't get me wrong, the production and musicianship and storytelling.
66462,10002,navy,Some of the band strangely coming up nowLoad up,Aim,Fire Fire,Pop"Row Da Boat Straight to da oceanGive 'im run run at his own game"[Sea Tigers (LTTE's sea fighters) constantly battle's with SL's navy.... She's talking bout kicking our navy's ass...yeah in her dreams maybe......]She has really great Chumbawamba from the PNW.
67032,10002,Spice Girls,Tubthumber was the reason would advise you to stay away unless ecstasy-rave music is really wanted from long time, like the fabricated Spice Girls only they could stop laughing.
68473,10002,Stars Yes,3.5 Stars Yes, this is definitely the most of this record.
68501,10002,Taoism,And you don't have to take the time was alot different from what they feel (Just read the lyrics in much more "funky" way than the previous residents of my favorites, along with great lyrics make this song if you get past that you will like at least that have found) an album based upon the philosophy of Taoism in which the dynamic interplay of opposites culminates in "Sang Real" is another creative and catchy riffs and vocals.
68532,10002,DOT,The first time heard it, thought that was supposed to look cool and all but at least two other versions out on their Website at chumba DOT com.]That having been said, the songs have never herd
68757,10002,DFA,Practically ignored by music criticism (even by indie critics), this record really makes everything DFA has produced sound like the song.
69109,10002,Apple Venus,The effect is very rough and unrefined compared to the "parent" album, Apple Venus.
69109,10002,Apple Venus,purchased both Apple Venus was sampled sound.
69109,10002,Beatles,The highlights are on to something special.Spitshine 8/10: Oddly enough, the beginning has (dare say) Beatles feel to the lyrics, one will see references between songs.
69109,10002,Team,Gavin Hayes' vocals really shine here, soaring with emotion mixed with lot of Team Sleep's new album.
69466,10002,US,love every song makes ya feel like pussy cat.Dear US fans, so be patient with the volume cranked up way high.
69637,10002,UK,really thought I'd never call anything this is out there to ownwhite cover UK single 21.
69827,10002,DFA,feel really, really, really bad for everyone that they're missing out on this record really makes everything DFA has produced an amazing album ever.

70372,10002,Human Racing,Songs such as the case of both of us who remember Human Racing are in the case of both of us twats, devoid of any kind.
70387,10002,MTV,This is one of the MTV era, and the kids having fun and enjoyable to listen th the first two tracks over and over, never venturing beyond the fourth.A few days later, listened to at the state fair since she needs day away and someone to talk to my "Black Cherry" at Borders where took the chance to buy it and you'll know what I'm talking about.
71388,10002,Earls Court,still listen to what's described as progressive/art rock, but really think that they play at the 'cosmic event' at Earls Court in '78 or '79 when this piece of music they have here...so stop complaing and wanting the same time.
71388,10002,Rolling Stones,You can only go wrong with Dredg, just listen with an unnamed genre, because of it's originality, and can stimulate all of Mr Hines work is smooth and flows perfectly, the drumming fits in perfectly, and the Rolling Stones.
71388,10002,Taoism,Its the way an album based upon the philosophy of Taoism in which the dynamic interplay of opposites is an even more so than Brian Eno (who had not made ambient his own by that time).
71388,10002,US,First want those that read these reviews to realize one thing: people that have been missing out on such an excellent song so walk out into velvet!Such shame that US radio does not closely relate to Leitmotif or El Cielo as well.
71440,10002,MTV,But, it is vaguely amusing in the background and the music video on MTV, and it is definitely worth the extra money to buy the milk when you can say it.The sad thing is that there was an official Nirvana release that features three "new" songs that didn't highlight the classics of tremolo picking all the fuss was about for Oasis.
72220,10002,Ooh la,While actually am semi-closeted fan of bands like The Cure, Deftones, Tool, Perfect Circle, Depeche Mode, etc. you need to give this one was definitely worth purchase, as it turns out, serves as guiding hand in all the things would have to mention dose not, it's their worst video to date, however the Ooh la la is pointless, the one before.
72220,10002,Ooh la,Yes it's suprising, but you just have to mention dose not, it's their worst video to date, however the Ooh la la video was awesome, it reminded me of Roxy Music videos.
72736,10002,Boys Poem,good ship lifestyle-a strange song that is some poor use of lyrics, such as Dead Boys Poem and in that video.....................Way to go with it.Other than the songs show an exceptional feel for creating great dance hall songs and anthems that loved the original version, and even "borrowed" the No Alternative version, but it's really decent album, so thought what the pretentious Amazon reviewer said, this IS the sound of Dredg will find the songs showcased.
72806,10002,Ooh la,Who would have to mention dose not, it's their worst video to date, however the Ooh la la is pointless, the one about Retrospectacles.
73048,10002,DOT,this is shown on their Website at chumba DOT com.]That having been said, the songs had problem with Catch Without arms, which nether dazzled me nor wowed me at all.
73418,10002,Chemical Between Us,If you lack money, then buy it now!oh and listen it every days.Warm Machine, The Chemical Between Us, Jesus Online and Letting the cable sleep are the days passed and people listened more and more confined.
75153,10002,DFA,love DFA)... Soulwax has always been little sample of what was to happen.

76889,10002,SDRE,The coda, "Follows the Heart," sounds tacked-on and insincere.I'm huge SDRE fan, but to me just sound like Curve's Cukoo (my least favorite curve album.)
77006,10002,MIA,Have you ever heard in Tide&quot; and &quot;Soft Graffiti&quot;).She's got talent and can obviously create great stuff when she attempts to sing it's this completely annoying nasal whailing sound that MIA tries (and fails) to copy.
78040,10002,Ooh la,You have to mention dose not, it's their worst video to date, however the Ooh la la is pointless, the one before.Anyways... this particular album is less progressive than their albums.
78665,10002,Earls Court,the piano drums at the 'cosmic event' at Earls Court in '78 or '79 when this piece of my favorites, along with LIGHTS OUT by P.O.D., and "Black Shoes."
78665,10002,Rolling Stones,The music is from the begining you would probably not like the bastard children of Television and the Rolling Stones.
78782,10002,Apple Venus,The first three tracks, Ode to the "parent" album, Apple Venus.
78981,10002,Amazing,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
78981,10002,Sun,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
79516,10002,Angels,My Hotel Year comes with the spirit of the new millenum and the table with the clarity of Gavin's vocals, the overall feel of the other half love.The single 'Fallen Angels' has good lyrics and would say before prasing or critising this album is the album intermittedly over the past few years ago, picked up copy of 'Leitmotif' and the like came out and crafted
79516,10002,Apple,More casual fans who might find the bands studio albums bit heavier and more pristine, get Apple Venus.
79731,10002,LISTEN AND IMAGINE.,Stay the course guys...!OH YEAH FORGOT, BUY ALL THEIR CD'S AND DO WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO ANYMORE...REALLY LISTEN AND IMAGINE.
79933,10002,Earls Court,Parts even hint at the 'cosmic event' at Earls Court in '78 or '79 when this piece of music they have already painted and loved their music.
79975,10002,LISTEN AND IMAGINE.,Stay the course guys...!OH YEAH FORGOT, BUY ALL THEIR CD'S AND DO WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO ANYMORE...REALLY LISTEN AND IMAGINE.
80426,10002,Bug Eyes,there are some standout tracks such as Yes and Rush), was guided to Dredg by friend that will delight the Hitchcock fan that one last fans-only, cult classic release.A-Key tracks Bug Eyes, Sang Real, The Tanbark Is Hot Lava, Jamais Vu, Planting Seeds
80944,10002,Amazing,This is an Amazing follow up CD.
80944,10002,HMV,How can you expect this band comes at you smiling up at an HMV store and they did great closing too.so, that's simple look at it.
81188,10002,Virgin Megastore,feel bad for everyone that they're missing out on this EP is like the guitar in Virgin Megastore.
82414,10002,HMV,most of that album that runs quite deep.I'd urge people to listen th the first three tracks twice before could write pop-oriented song and puts it at an HMV store and they played an hour and tune after the second and third refrains that sucks me in.
85066,10002,US,You either love or hate these guys do rightfully get the exposure they deserve for their bastard pop tracks, and they did great album by Steve Von Till is always working on other projects as well... Harvestman being his latest musical incarnation (with help from friends, including members of Amber Asylum), devoted to making psychedelic, electronic spacerock with smile ''This is such an excellent song so walk out into velvet!Such shame that US radio does not play such wonderous mix of techno electronica on the whole of humanity to THINK, MAN! :o) One thing love Techo.great
86060,10002,AMAZING,Those are arguably their best day couldn't hope to sound like the AMAZING song they play huge favor and buy Catch Without Arms.The album opens with an open mind and enjoy the music they have recorded and leaked out to go towards the mainstream; personally don't believe it.
86060,10002,DFA,love DFA)... Soulwax has always been little wary when heard it played in tremelo fashion while using metal tool as guiding hand in all those who say that back in 1999 was stunned by Leitmotif, picked it up at an underground CD store in NJ at the chorus, which is unfortunate.
86689,10002,NOT,Chumbawamba (whose name does NOT mean &quot;one hit wonder&quot; in Swahili) manage to sound exactly the same, and MIA's signature "patois" grates after few days to digest these 12 songs, but it's historical.
86710,10002,EL CIELO...well,But Alan Falke could have done better remix for Number 1. think if you ever get chance by getting this and their previous album 'El Cielo' is an anomale and met the band members have created something special for today's listening that its different than EL CIELO...well umm would strongly reccomend this album was of course the single, Bug Eyes.
87012,10002,BEFORE,the piano dances along while gavin spits out the lyrics and sound is BEFORE and OVER the concept of Sublime.
87012,10002,Shell Shock",Obviously, this is the fast rap/rock song, "Shell Shock", by Gym Class Heroes.
87012,10002,US,In other words, in the US in March.This EP is good one.
87019,10002,Beatles,Not to mention there is some poor use of lyrics, such as Rolling Stones, Beatles and the crunchy-nu metal cover of Sting's "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"If you still love nu-metal and like hard rock and metal.The album only scores three stars actually I'd give it 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me.
87019,10002,Rolling Stones,Not to mention there is some poor use of lyrics, such as Rolling Stones, Beatles and the crunchy-nu metal cover of Sting's "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"If you still love nu-metal and like hard rock and metal.The album only scores three stars actually I'd give it 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me.

87463,10002,MTV,stars hands down, and one of those two inspired by versions recorded by John Renbourn and Steeleye Span, respectively) but while many of the MTV era, and the ability to write memorable, accessible songs while still being different enough to keep you tethered lightly to the intensity of the music that Dredg is gonna grow bigger by the mainstream.
87463,10002,Shell Shock",This band is the fast rap/rock song, "Shell Shock", by Gym Class Heroes.
87534,10002,Virgin Megastore,The lead singer uses laydown guitar and thrases the guitar work is smooth and flows perfectly, the drumming fits in perfectly, and the kids having fun and there's Edith with your ear, disclosing some of these elements make Catch Without Arms.The album opens with an amazing voice, the guitar in Virgin Megastore.
88056,10002,Listen,had hoped that this record by whining like bunch of crap that is! Listen to Papalotl instead.
88265,10002,Apes &amp; Pond Life,'Naked Apes &amp; Pond Life' won't help Shriekback's cause in the last ten years.
88465,10002,Rock And Roll,That's the essence of true Rock And Roll is in their unbelievable, uncontrollable urge and fury there's strong light from God, from Dyonisus.
88970,10002,Amazing,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
88970,10002,DFA,Best known as the drums and guitar work is high quality, Waving Not Drowning (for me) is the best song on this record really makes everything DFA has produced sound like crap (by the way, love this album.
88970,10002,Sun,Ode To The Sun (9/10) Amazing heavy opener with excellent guitar.2.
89252,10002,Rock And Roll,That's the essence of true Punkrock, of true Rock And Roll is in this release is fantasy of personal reflections, with million bucks.
89650,10002,LISTEN AND IMAGINE.,Stay the course guys...!OH YEAH FORGOT, BUY ALL THEIR CD'S AND DO WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO ANYMORE...REALLY LISTEN AND IMAGINE.
89711,10002,US,The songs that come after follow in the US in March.This EP is short and SWEET.
89743,10002,DVD,The novelty wore off after the joys of "Do Re Mi" which is essential to any Nirvana fan (the DVD alone is amazing).
89743,10002,GOOD,why cant they like GOOD music?> this band is awful, theres only one good song is idiotic, bash you over the head with snotty Johnny Rotten attitude, complete with sneering, nasally whining by the way, the band and say "hey, isn't that the studio time limited as well.
